## Context

This site is a showcase for an aspiring photographer's work, which is available to purchase on either card or enlarged print.

Since moving to the countryside, Penny has found herself increasingly inspired by her beautiful surroundings and is keen to share them with a wider audience. More than ever in these uncertain, digital times, there's comfort to be found in a personal message written on a physical card, adorned with beautiful, candid pictures of nature.

## UX

### Overview

The site is aimed at people looking for greeting cards, specifically those who value supporting local endeavours rather than large, established corporations. The siteâ€™s intended audience are people who value the personal touch and ability to communicate directly with the seller.

The enterprise is humble but, as evidenced by the quality of the pictures, has a wealth of emotive images from the English countryside to share. These are the scenes we may all have witnessed but which are seldom captured.

### User stories

For ease of reference, the means by which a user's expectations have been met are summarised in the tables below:

| As a **client** I want                                                                                                                                    | How this is achieved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Seven individuals contributed to testing the site and provided feedback on its layout, responsiveness and styling at various points in development.

<span id="ux-wireframes"></span>

### Wireframes

Overall the wireframes were successfully converted into a functioning website, however there were some deviations from the plan. These were:

1. A circular image divided up into four seasons (with the same functionality as the intro gallery images on the landing page) was originally envisaged, however it was not possible to create this to the desired standard in the time available, so the idea was dropped. Furthermore, the page structure required would have been unnecessarily complex and ultimately misleading and repetitive.
2. The option to Sign In was planned to appear below the Sign Up form, however as the project advanced it was apparent that this was not a needed feature in this first iteration. The decision was made to simplify the design and stick to the core requirement of providing a means to subscribe to information rather than to log in with no purpose. The benefits of signing into the site are more closely tied to the (as yet) unrealised shopping basket feature and will be explored in future.

The full suite of wireframes for **desktop**, **tablet** and **mobile** devices, plus a **sitemap**, can be accessed [here](wireframes/).

### Site theme

Based on the client's brief and visitors' expectations for the site, a clean, simple aesthetic has been adopted. In previous iterations the theme was more minimalistic in an attempt to focus purely on the content, but this was counterintuitive as the lack of contrast reduced the visibility of important elements and overall the site lacked identity.

Two fonts with a soft, warm style have been used across the site: [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans).

At this point, user feedback suggested changing the hero image and after doing so, [Color Scheme Designer](https://colorschemedesigner.com/csd-3.5/) was used to pull out several complimentary and web-friendly colours (#036, #39C, #960) which tied in with the new hero image. The result is a much more vibrant aesthetic based on blues and gold, which gives the site a bolder appearance and more character. Furthermore, visual feedback for user actions became much clearer and the identity of separate elements (e.g images with shadows, golden horizontal rules to indicate headings etc) became more apparent. At a late stage in development the Pricing tables were given a border shadow consistent with the rest of the site, as feedback suggested the Pricing page was the weakest page, aesthetically.

<span id="features"></span>

## Features

<span id="features-all"></span>

### Site-wide

**1. Navbar**

- Collapses into a hamburger icon to support the mobile browsing experience
- Brand maintains visibility on all device sizes
- Brand acts as the Home button to avoid duplication and clutter
- Gallery dropdown options are scrollable on mobile devices in landscape orientation to prevent frustrating case of hidden options
- Gallery dropdown includes an 'All' option to prevent hesitation on clicking through. It might otherwise be assumed on first visit that these were separate pages
- High contrast hoverable links provide responsive visual feedback
- Active links clearly indicate current location on site (while Brand is left consistently white)
- Shopping basket for quick access to purchasing selected items (for future implementation and currently disabled)

**2. Footer**

- Social media links with a blank target to prevent disruption to the browsing experience
- Copyright
- Footer is always positioned at the bottom of the page for consistency and visual appeal (primarily for larger displays where content would otherwise not fill the viewport)

<span id="features-pages"></span>

### Pages

**3. Landing page**

- Full viewport hero image to showcase the photographer's imagery (primary goal) and promote the site's colour scheme
- Transparent jumbotron to emphasise the name of the site
- Call to action button linking to the gallery and inviting to purchase (primary goal)
- Succinct and clear introduction outlining the purpose of the site
- Mini gallery showcasing the different themes of images, including links for quick access to the respective sections of the full gallery as well as responsive visual feedback

**4. About**

- Provides the voice of the photographer, plus their background, credentials and reason for setting up the site
- Headshot of the photographer
- Link to email photographer directly with email subject placeholder to encourage completion

**5. Pricing**

- Brief description of product
- Two clear tables with prices for both cards and prints, including price per unit for multiple orders and statement that postage not included

**6. Gallery**

- Brief introduction explaining how to add items to basket and how to view in full aspect ratio
- Six themed sections (Canals, Coast, Flora and Fauna, Flowers, Landscapes, Trees)
- On mobile, images are clearly displayed in their original aspect ratio, while on larger devices they are displayed uniformly cropped and in a responsive grid for easy browsing
- Clear 'Add (to basket)' button in consistent position on all images. Enables users to add an item to shopping cart (with just two clicks from the landing page) and includes visual feedback on hover
- Ability to enlarge images by clicking on them, and to scroll through a pop-up gallery of images in full aspect ratio. Clicking outside viewing area (or swiping up/down on mobile) returns visitor to the normal gallery
- Within pop-up gallery, user can view thumbnails of all images and use the mouse wheel or swipe to scroll through
- Names of each image are included at bottom of pop-up gallery, providing some context for each scene and enabling visitors to ask specific questions of the photographer
- All images have an appropriate `alt` entry to accomodate screen reading software
- Image sizes are all below 300kb for faster loading, while preserving FHD resolution to showcase their quality

**7. Signup**

- Simple form allows the user to sign up for more information and news of fresh images being added to gallery
- Validation of user inputs (blank fields, typical email format), indicating any errors clearly

<span id="features-future"></span>

### Features left to implement

- Shopping basket and purchasing functions

  _This crucial missing feature will include payment options (multiple item purchase, choice of size), purchase history and the option to save delivery address and card details for repeat purchases_

- Ability to search for specific images / metadata

  _e.g results for â€˜deerâ€™, â€˜butterflyâ€™, â€˜waterâ€™, â€˜waterâ€™, â€˜sunsetâ€™, â€˜rocksâ€™, â€˜tractorâ€™_

- Additional browsing criteria

  _e.g seasons, landscape / portrait_

- Mock-up of image for chosen options

  _e.g 'Show me what Twisted Tree looks like on a card / in large print'_

- Option to order cards with a choice of messages / bespoke messages

- Improved form validation

## Testing

<span id="testing-auto"></span>

### Automated testing

- [Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools) - ran an audit on all pages for both desktop and mobile.

Summary:

- Performance = **Average**
  - The worst metric due to issues around image size and not using next-gen filetypes, particularly on gallery.html where the score was 74% on mobile - it is beyond the scope of this project to address this
  - Unused CSS - removed hover.min.css from all but index.html where it is used on the intro gallery images
- Accessibility = **Good**
  - Various links missing discernable names (mainly nav bar and footer) - fixed by adding aria labels to all links across the site
  - Insufficient contrast ratio on hero image and nav bar Brand
  - Lowest score 96% on desktop following amendments
- Best Practices = **Good**
  - Front-end Javascript libraries with known security vulnerabilities (Bootstrap and jQuery) - it is beyond the scope of this project to address this
- SEO = **Good**
  - `head` was missing `<meta name="description" content="..." />` - fixed
  - Scores 95% on Gallery due to 'Add' button being smaller than 48px x 48px. Tested with larger button sizes but they took up too much real estate - it is beyond the scope of this project to address this
  - Scores 100% across all other pages following amendments

Mobile scores:

- [CSS Lint](http://csslint.net/) - 0 errors, 56 warnings - **PASS**
  - Don't use IDs in selectors
  - Compatible vendor prefixes
- [W3C - HTML](https://validator.w3.org/) - On update no HTML errors or warnings detected - **PASS**
  - `alt` tags missing
  - call to action `button` with `type="button"` identified as an issue
  - `section` without heading element
- [W3C - CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) - no CSS errors detected - **PASS**
  - Update: passing CSS code through [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) produced 47 warnings related to unknown vendor extensions
- [Unicorn revealer - overflow](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/unicorn-revealer/lmlkphhdlngaicolpmaakfmhplagoaln/related) - tested all pages and no evidence of overflow - **PASS**
